# TODO

* [x] Optimize the twig->run(). For some reason, a middleware is taking too much time
  * [ ] Cache the folder hierarchy.
  * [ ] issue with the debugBar. This is slow as hell.
* [ ] add a cache when not in debug for the routes so we don't have to parse all the files.
* [ ] Add better documentation for the debugBar
